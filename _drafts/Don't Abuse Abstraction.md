# Don't Abuse Abstraction

## Abstraction(OO) is powerful

Most people learn programming using Object-Oriented language, (In those dark old times, OO dominated, scripts only glittered a bit in the corner). This OO way of programming things programe people's way of thinking. I see a problem, model some `Class`es, define `properties`, write some private `methods`, interface, nails it.

The OO paradim excel on mapping real world into code. It is powerful when you deal with game programming or writing user interface code. 

## Module, rather than abstraction(OO)

I was quite confused when I first saw how `Class` inherits another `Class`. The son `Class` has to take all bullshits from his father `Class` and he's only allowed to have one father? Crazy. And any reasonable people shouldn't write a grandson `Class` because the grandson always forgets who's the grandfather and what he is capable of. Obviously, OO is not the answer.

what OO fans really need is module. First of all, you hardly need inheritance. There is more than one way to reuse things without the cost of reusing too much and being confused. Second, Object is not universal, Module is. Module can be anything, objects, actions, relations between things.

## Abstraction is a tool

Abstraction is no more than a tool, for managing complexity. In many situations, people turn to abstraction and abuse it when they really don't understand the problems themselves.

OO does a great job expressing **relation** complexity, such as relations between characters and objects. Attacks, healing, ability, parameters of the physical world, `Class`es handle these numbers quite smoothly.
