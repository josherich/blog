###common enemy makes friends, common negative feeling makes friends
	Mediocre is the biggest sin

When I saw one of my colleages being an asshole, speaking ill of others in public, that's the first thing came into my mind. I guess most people heard of this somewhere. After being presented so many stories of how successful people make their fortune, it's quite hard to admire mediocre and ordinary people. But these are like formula or rules, instead of feelings. Whatever how much people believe being kind is overruled by being effective and productive, people still feels sympathy.

Being honest is quite tricky, assholes are usually honest, but they are assholes. When I think a little upon how they differ on being honest, they say the same thing in the first phase, honest people state the facts, without any opinion. And the second phase, people begin to infer some facts, about the cause and effect, context of making this mistake and action to fix it and avoid it in the future. Assholes go further, they usually go too far on the inference, and mix opinions with facts. They invented facts based on personal opinions.

It seems that people tend to assume a lot to complete judgements. It's like we have to make judgement on things happening right now instantly. So there's not much time for each piece. When you see a dumb face, you give him an identity instantly.
Assholes dont't realize this instant.
