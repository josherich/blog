### It takes a lot to invert a binary

[invert a binary](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4338315/inverting-a-binary-value-of-a-number
)

```js
var x = 793; // input value
var y = x.toString(2);
var yl = y.length;
var mask = (Math.pow(2, yl) - 1); // calculate mask
var result = ~x & mask;
document.write(result.toString(2))
```

and you need to handle negative number as negative numbers use 2's complement notation

```js
var x = -1
(~x).toString(2);
```

### Beautiful array has a beatiful solution

[Odd + Even Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-array/discuss/186679/Odd-%2B-Even-Pattern-O(N))

array a is a permutation of 1...N, for any pair i and j, no i < k < j s.t. a[k] * 2 = a[i] + a[j]

start from [1], construct concatenation of odd and even array(if we have equality a[k] * 2 = a[i] + a[j], i,j,k must have at least one odd, or one even number). Multiplication, addition constant and concatenation keep the i,j,k invariant.

```js
[1]
[1]       + [2]
[1,3]     + [2,4]
[1,5,3,7] + [2,6,4,8]
...
```

### Array from trick to implement range(N)

```js
let N = 10
let arr=Array.from({length:N}, (x,i)=>i+1);
```

### continuations

it transforms all code into a state machine and uses exceptions to save the state of all functions on the stack. This means that every function is transformed into a big switch statement with every expression as separate cases, giving us the ability to arbitrarily jump around.

wiki says:
an abstract representation of the control state of a computer program. A continuation reifies the program control state‚Ä¶

call/cc:  call-with-current-continuation

### private method leaks

```js
function somePublicApi() {
  console.log('public api called.')
}

(function() {
  var privateFuncOne = function() {
    console.log('secret one called.')
    somePublicApi()
  }

  var privateFuncTwo = function() {
    console.log('secret two called.')
    privateFuncOne()
  }

  window.exportFunc = function() {
    privateFuncTwo()
  }

}).call(this)

let privateFuncOne, privateFuncTwo
somePublicApi = function() {
  privateFuncOne = arguments.callee.caller;
  privateFuncTwo = privateFuncOne.caller;
}

exportFunc()
console.log(privateFuncOne)
console.log(privateFuncTwo)
```

### bytecode peephole optimization

count regexp usage, if 'hot', compile it to native code

```js
const re = /[^_]*/;
const str = 'a0b*c_ef';
re.exec(str);
// ‚Üí matches 'a0b*c'
```

1. Load current character.
2. Check if character equals '_'.
3. If not, advance current position in the subject string and goto 1.

replace sequences of bytecodes with a new optimized bytecode that combines the functionality of multiple bytecodes

can even handle the implicit loop created by the goto explicitly in the new bytecode, thus a single bytecode handles all matching characters, saving 16 dispatches.

    - control flow graph, group nodes to blocks
    - reduction
      - compute int range
      - compute limits
      - apply range and limits to decide length check is unnecessary

### [pairs of strings without common chars](https://www.quora.com/Given-a-dictionary-of-words-how-can-we-efficiently-find-a-pair-words-if-they-dont-have-characters-in-common-and-the-sum-of-their-length-is-the-maximum)

Our algorithm will consist of three steps:
1. For each set S of letters, find the longest word that consists of exactly those letters.
2. For each set S of letters, find the longest word that consists of at most those letters (i.e., some letters may be unused, but you cannot use a letter that does not belong to S).
3. For each word w, compute length(w) + length(longest word out of letters not in w) and pick the maximum.

Step 1 is easy: just take an array of size 2ùëé, then read the input, and for each word update the corresponding cell. This can be done in ùëÇ(‚Ñìùëõ).

Step 2 can be done using dynamic programming. We process the subsets of our alphabet in the order 0, 1, ..., 2ùëé‚àí1. (Note that this  order that has the property that for any set S, all subsets of S are processed before S.) For each set of letters S, the best word for S is either the best word made out of exactly these letters (this we computed in phase 1), or at least one letter is unused. We try all possibilities for the unused letter and pick the best one. All of this takes ùëÇ(ùëé2ùëé) time.

Step 3 is again easy. If we stored the set of letters for each word in step 1, step 3 can now be done in ùëÇ(ùëõ) time. Hence the overall time complexity is ùëÇ(‚Ñìùëõ+ùëé2ùëé).

Web Animations API

transition: transform 500ms ease-out;
transition: transform 500ms cubic-bezier(0.465, 0.183, 0.153, 0.946);

Ensure that any animating element has will-change set for anything you plan to change well ahead of the animation starting. For view transitions, it‚Äôs highly likely you will want to use will-change: transform.

UI trigger by user: quick intro, slow outro
display as quick as 100ms, view out as quick as 300ms

UI trigger by code(err, modal): slow intro, quick outro

CSS-based animations, and Web Animations where supported natively, are typically handled on a thread known as the "compositor thread"

Include initial-scale=1 to establish a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels.

### media query

```
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 640px)" href="max-640px.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(min-width: 640px)" href="min-640px.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(orientation: portrait)" href="portrait.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(orientation: landscape)" href="landscape.css">
<style>
  @media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 600px) {
    h1 {
      color: fuchsia;
    }

    .desc:after {
      content:" In fact, it's between 500px and 600px wide.";
    }
  }
</style>
```

- don't use `min-device-width`

min-width is based on the size of the browser window whereas min-device-width is based on the size of the screen. Unfortunately some browsers, including the legacy Android browser, don't report the device width properly; they report the screen size in device pixels instead of the expected viewport width.

In addition, using min-device-width can prevent content from adapting on desktops or other devices that allow windows to be resized because the query is based on the actual device size, not the size of the browser window.

-  setting width: 100% on a top level div, ensures that it spans the width of the viewport and is never too big or too small for the viewport.

- Classic readability theory suggests that an ideal column should contain 70 to 80 characters per line (about 8 to 10 words in English)

### [heuristics and observations of teams resolving internet service outages](https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/01/22/trade-offs-under-pressure-part-1/)

Klein shows us that teams have some advantages over individuals:
  - a wider range of attention
  - a broader range of expertise
  - built-in variability
  - a greater capability for reorganising their activities
  - and the ability to work in parallel

Hollnagel enumerates a set of judgement heuristics often used in scenarios involving uncertainty and multiple conflicting goals:
  - ETTO (efficiency-thoroughness trade-off)
  - Similarity matching ‚Äì judging the similarity between triggering conditions and stored attributes of appropriate action
  - Frequency gambling ‚Äì choosing among partially matched options based on the frequency of their occurence
  - Representativeness ‚Äì if it looks like X, it probably is X
  - Availability ‚Äì choosing by how easily the option comes to mind
  - Focus gambling ‚Äì opportunistically changing from one hypothesis to another
  - Conservative gambling ‚Äì moving slowly and incrementally to build up a hypothesis
  - Simultaneous scanning ‚Äì trying out several hypotheses at the same time

thematic vagabonding: Too much jumping between options, never getting deep enough in any one area

cognitive fixation: people can become fixated on a specific idea or solution even to the exclusion of incoming signals that indicate otherwise

case study etsy:

- the big slowdown came because the 400 errors for the missing shop data bypassed the caching mechanism, causing a full request to be made on every page load

- "process tracing"

four heuristic emerged
- First look for any correlation to the last change made to the system
- If no correlated change is implicated, then widen the diagnostic search space to any potential signals
- When forming hypotheses and evaluating diagnostic directions, use pattern matching of signals or symptoms to either specific past events or recent events.
- During incident management, prefer peer review of any code changes to gain confidence as opposed to automated tests or other procedures.

> the greatest sources of success in automation-rich environments are (perhaps ironically) the adaptive capacities of human cognition and activity, not the pseudo-intelligence of the software

  history.replaceState(obj, document.title);
  const copy = history.state;
  history.replaceState(oldState, document.title);
  return copy;
}

const obj = /* ... */;
const clone = structuralClone(obj);
```

### deep copy using MessageChannel

handle cyclical data structures, built-in data types like Map, Set and ArrayBuffer etc.

```js
function structuralClone(obj) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    const {port1, port2} = new MessageChannel();
    port2.onmessage = ev => resolve(ev.data);
    port1.postMessage(obj);
  });
}

const obj = /* ... */;
const clone = await structuralClone(obj);
```

### [postMessage perf](https://dassur.ma/things/is-postmessage-slow/)

Even on the slowest devices, you can postMessage() objects up to 100KiB and stay within your 100ms response budget. If you have JS-driven animations, payloads up to 10KiB are risk-free.

tech postmortem blog post

cargo cult diffusion

> If there were an acute failure, you might see a postmortem, but while we'll do postmortems for "the site was down for 30 seconds", we rarely do postmortems for "this takes 10x as much ops effort as the alternative and it's a death by a thousand papercuts", "we architected this thing poorly and now it's very difficult to make changes that ought to be trivial", or "a competitor of ours was able to accomplish the same thing with an order of magnitude less effort". I'll sometimes do informal postmortems by asking everyone involved oblique questions about what happened, but more for my own benefit than anything else, because I'm not sure people really want to hear the whole truth. This is especially sensitive if the effort has generated a round of promotions, which seems to be more common the more screwed up the project. The larger the project, the more visibility and promotions, even if the project could have been done with much less effort.
