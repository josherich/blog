### It takes a lot to invert a binary

[invert a binary](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4338315/inverting-a-binary-value-of-a-number
)

```js
var x = 793; // input value
var y = x.toString(2);
var yl = y.length;
var mask = (Math.pow(2, yl) - 1); // calculate mask
var result = ~x & mask;
document.write(result.toString(2))
```

and you need to handle negative number as negative numbers use 2's complement notation

```js
var x = -1
(~x).toString(2);
```

### Beautiful array has a beatiful solution

array a is a permutation of 1...N, for any pair i and j, no i < k < j s.t. a[k] * 2 = a[i] + a[j]

start from [1], construct concatenation of odd and even array(if we have equality a[k] * 2 = a[i] + a[j], i,j,k must have at least one odd, or one even number). Multiplication, addition constant and concatenation keep the i,j,k invariant.

```js
[1]
[1]       + [2]
[1,3]     + [2,4]
[1,5,3,7] + [2,6,4,8]
...
```

### Array from trick to implement range(N)

```js
let N = 10
let arr=Array.from({length:N}, (x,i)=>i+1);
```
