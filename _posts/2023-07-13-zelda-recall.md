I find it very confusing that the orb in Kudanisar shrine ends up being recalled, but there is no cue for players to tell the orb's recall duration is not 20s, instead it is infinite.

Another interesting design choice about recall is the near-infinite range. There's also almost no limitation with the recall target.

The 20s seems to be the main factor that prevents it from breaking the game mechanics.
