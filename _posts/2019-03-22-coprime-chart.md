## Co-prime

The whole set of coprime can be generated by two disjoint sets of ternary trees, one(red) from (2,1), and the other(blue) from (3,1). [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers#Generating_all_coprime_pairs)

## Collatz Conjecture

If the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
