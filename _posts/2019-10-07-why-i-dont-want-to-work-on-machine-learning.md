paper inflation

you have to put a lot of time

intelligence intensity is inflated and low

it's disappointing when you apply the stoa method into the wild

everything is about ml, except ml, ml is about power

## good part

statistics is universal

linear algebra is universal

attack old problems, make old problems great again
