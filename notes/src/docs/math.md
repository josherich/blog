### matrix exp, e^A

taylor expansion, well defined

can directly write ODE solution: 

dx/dt = Ax

x = exp(tA)x_0

if A is diagonalizable, A = PvP^-1, v is diagonal matrix

exp(A) = P exp(v) P^-1

inverse is exp(-A)


### Matrix hermitian

### Singular Matrix

A square matrix that is not invertible is called singular or degenerate. A square matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is 0.

### optimal transfer

### Topology of tanh Layers

transformations don’t affect topology, are called homeomorphisms

tanh (and sigmoid and softplus but not ReLU) are continuous functions with continuous inverses


## Numerical Methods

Qs:

how stiff

how many vars

how accrate

how sensitive(chaos)

how well-behaved is f(x,t)

how costly is f(x,t) and its jacobian

implicit, 

more stable, solving stiff problems requires implicit methods

stability criterion

x'(t) = a x(t)

forward euler is conditionally stable

backward euler is unconditionally stable

truncation error

Runge-Kutta methods

instability

zero stability

### absolute stability for a method

Re(lambda) < 0, x'(t) = lambda x(t) numerical solution decays to 0

region of absolute stability z = \lambda \delta t

all scaled eigenvalues of Jacobian should be in region, for ODE system

### A-stable

stability region contains the entire lefthalf plane

backward euler, implicit midpoint

no explicit one-step method can be A-stable

All explicit RK methods with r stages and of order r have the same stability region

### L-stable

if it is A-stable and it damps fast componentsof the solution

### stiffness

A stiff problem is one where ∆t has to be small even though the solution is smooth and a large ∆t is OK for accuracy

### ODE stiffness

if the solution evolves on widely-separated timescales and the fast time scale decays (dies out) quickly

given linear ODE system, x'(t) = A x(t), decompose A to separate parts, x is formed by uncoupled n different y variables, each of n ODEs(y) is independent of the others

timestep of original system must be smaller than the smallest stability limits

the system is stiff if a strong separation of stability time scale (eigenvalue ratio)

Jacobian for non-linear system, complex eigenvalues

adjoint method

auto diff



## Group

半格是满足运算是幂等的和交换的半群。

半群是闭合于结合性二元运算之下的集合 S 构成的代数结构

> 集合S和其上的二元运算·:S×S→S。若·满足结合律，即：∀x,y,z∈S，有(x·y)·z=x·(y·z)，则称有序对(S,·)为半群

**history monoid** is a way of representing the histories of concurrently running computer processes as a collection of strings, each string representing the individual history of a process

考虑任意一个偏序集合（L,≤），如果对集合L中的任意元素a,b，使得a,b在L中存在一个最大下界，和最小上界，则(L,≤)是一个格

一个格是完全的，如果它的所有子集都有一个交和一个并

> [heteroskedastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity)

  a collection of random variables is heteroscedastic (or heteroskedastic;[a] from Ancient Greek hetero “different” and skedasis “dispersion”) if there are sub-populations that have different variabilities from others
