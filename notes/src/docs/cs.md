## NP-hardness

> non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness

a problem H is NP-hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H; that is, assuming a solution for H takes 1 unit time, we can use H‎'s solution to solve L in polynomial time.

## P is not NP

> If P ≠ NP, then NP-hard problems cannot be solved in polynomial time.

# Formal method

- specification: functional behavior or non-functional properties
- modeling: extract formal models from specs, implementations, verification artifacts such as test benches
- implementation: build parts of system
- execution: run in simulation, VM, hardware
- validation: execute, evaluate using runtime assertion checking
- verification: check properties of a model for all inputs/envs
